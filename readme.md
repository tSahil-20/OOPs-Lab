# OOP's Lab



##  Practical-1 Program to implement concept of class and object.

1. Write a program to calculate area, perimeter of each room your house.

    1. Print area and perimeter of each room.
    2. Print area and perimeter of whole house.
    
Assuming all rooms are reactangle in shape,

    1. Define class Room with data members and member function.
        Eg: Data members can be length and breadth and fuction can be area and perimeter.
    2. Number of room object = Number of room in your house.
    3. Calculate and print total area and perimeter.

2. Write a program to print area and perimeter of a circle having radius 5 by creating a class named Circle with a function to print the area and perimeter.

3. In a academic session, teacher wants to maintain student info. like a class, roll no, name, avg and topper name, topper marks is required at the end of session. Write a program to help the teacher.



##  Practical-2 Program to implement constructor and destructor.

1. Write a program to demonstrate calling sequence of constructor and destructor.
   
2. Write a program to print area and perimeter of a triangle. 

By creating a class named Tringle with,

    1. default constructor.
    2. argument/parameterized construtor to initialize data members.
    3. area() and perimeter() function


3. Print the Sum, Difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with seprate functions for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by the user.
